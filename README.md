# Omniauth CUBE7

[CUBE7](http://cube7.com) is an international Sales-Platform with all the functions and aspects of a social network
 
This gem contains the CUBE7 strategy for OmniAuth.

CUBE7 uses OAuth 2. This strategy implements the browser variant of the "Sign in with CUBE7" flow.

## Before You Begin

You should have already installed OmniAuth into your app; if not, read the [OmniAuth README](https://github.com/intridea/omniauth) to get started.

Now contact administrator of CUBE7 to create an application. Then you should get application_id and secret_key from him.  
Make sure to send a callback URL to administrator or else you may get authentication errors. (It doesn't matter what it is, just that it is set.)

## Usage

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'omniauth-cube7'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install omniauth-cube7

Next, tell OmniAuth about this provider. For a Rails app, your `config/initializers/omniauth.rb` file should look like this:

```ruby
Rails.application.config.middleware.use OmniAuth::Builder do
  provider :cube7, "APPLICATION_ID", "SECRET_KEY"
end
```

or

```ruby
Rails.application.config.middleware.use OmniAuth::Builder do
  provider :cube7, "APPLICATION_ID", "SECRET_KEY", client_options: {
    site: 'http://cube7.com',
    authorize_url: '/oauth/authorize',
  }
end
```

Replace APPLICATION_ID and SECRET_KEY with the appropriate values you obtained from administrator earlier.

## Authentication Hash

An example auth hash available in `request.env['omniauth.auth']`:

```ruby
{
  "provider"=>:cube7,
  "uid"=>11,
  "info"=>
  {
    "email"=>"ab@sevendevs.de",
    "first_name"=>"Alexander",
    "last_name"=>"Bierbrauer",
    "baio_status"=>1,
    "promo_code"=>123,
  },
  "credentials"=>
  {
    "token"=>"e8d6f6685e08ca8e3874a36d421de0020d6f714a3576c2c543726b18d5c3ce89",
    "expires_at"=>1391245607,
    "expires"=>true
  },
  "extra"=>{
    "raw_info"=>
    {
      "id"=>11,
      "email"=>"ab@sevendevs.de",
      "gender"=>"Male",
      "first_name"=>"Alexander",
      "second_name"=>"Bierbrauer",
      "baio_status"=>1,
      "promo_code"=>123,
    }
  }
}
```
